# Email Report Setup Guide

The email report functionality is now implemented and ready to use! Here's how to configure it:

## Current Status
- ✅ **Mock Email Service**: Currently active - logs email details to console
- ✅ **Report Generation**: PDF (HTML) and CSV formats supported
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: Complete with user-friendly modal interface
- ✅ **Backend API**: tRPC endpoint ready at `/api/trpc/reports.email`

## Testing the Mock Service

The app is currently configured to use a **mock email service** that logs email details to the console. This allows you to test the functionality without setting up real email credentials.

### How to Test:
1. Go to Reports tab in the admin panel or main reports screen
2. Click "Email Report" 
3. Enter any email address
4. Choose PDF or CSV format
5. Click "Send Report"
6. Check the server console/logs to see the email details

## Setting Up Real Email Services

To send actual emails, you need to:

1. **Choose an email provider** (options below)
2. **Add environment variables** to your project
3. **Update the email service configuration**

### Option 1: Gmail/SMTP (Recommended for testing)

Add these environment variables:
```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password  # Use App Password, not regular password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

Then in `/backend/trpc/routes/reports/email/route.ts`, change:
```typescript
provider: 'nodemailer' as 'mock' | 'nodemailer' | 'sendgrid',
```

**Install nodemailer:**
```bash
bun add nodemailer @types/nodemailer
```

**Uncomment the nodemailer code** in the `sendRealEmail` function.

### Option 2: SendGrid (Recommended for production)

Add environment variable:
```bash
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
EMAIL_FROM=your-verified-sender@yourdomain.com
```

Then change the provider to:
```typescript
provider: 'sendgrid' as 'mock' | 'nodemailer' | 'sendgrid',
```

**Install SendGrid:**
```bash
bun add @sendgrid/mail
```

**Uncomment the SendGrid code** in the `sendRealEmail` function.

### Option 3: Other Services

You can easily add support for other email services like:
- **Resend**: Modern email API
- **AWS SES**: Amazon's email service  
- **Mailgun**: Email service for developers
- **Postmark**: Transactional email service

Just implement the logic in the `sendRealEmail` function.

- ✅ **Professional Styling**: Clean, branded email templates

## Next Steps

1. **Test the mock service** to ensure everything works
2. **Choose your email provider** based on your needs
3. **Add environment variables** to your deployment
4. **Update the provider setting** in the code
5. **Install required packages** for your chosen provider
6. **Test with real emails**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Gmail**: Use App Passwords, not regular passwords
- **SendGrid**: Verify your sender email address first
- **Environment Variables**: Make sure they're loaded in your deployment
- **Firewall**: Ensure SMTP ports (587/465) aren't blocked

### Debug Mode:
The mock service logs all email details, so you can verify the report data is correct before switching to real email services.
